# Aura 5.0 | The Self-Sovereign Student OS

Aura is a high-fidelity, comprehensive operating environment designed for student resilience and cognitive optimization. Built for the **Build4Students Hackathon**, Aura addresses the fractured nature of student life—merging schoolwork, peer synergy, and mental wellness into a single, cohesive terminal.

## 🪐 The Problem & Solution

**The Problem**: Students today suffer from "Context Fragmentation." School assignments are in one app, wellness habits in another, peer communication in a third, and nutrition tracking in a fourth. This leads to cognitive load and metabolic burnout.

**The Solution**: Aura is a **Unified Student Resonance Stack**. It doesn't just track data; it synthesizes it. By merging research (Scholar), social connection (Village), and physiological habits (Balance) into a premium, minimalist environment, Aura reduces context switching and empowers students to focus on their destiny.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Scholar Lab**: Integrated AI research synthesis terminal with persistent vector mapping.
- **Village Synergy**: High-fidelity peer discovery engine centered on student-to-student collaboration.
- **Resilience Engine**: Atmospheric synchronized breathwork and systematic habit architecture.
- **Metabolic Analytics**: Weekly budgetary thresholds and nutritional synthesis planners.
- **Nexus Core**: A zero-config, "Self-Sovereign" architecture that persists data locally—protecting student privacy while ensuring seamless portability.

## 💎 Design Philosophy (Aura 5.0)

Aura follows a **High-Fidelity Minimalist** aesthetic. We avoid the "toy-like" designs common in education software. Instead, we use a warm ivory-and-charcoal palette, fluid physics-based animations (`framer-motion`), and rigorous typography to treat the student experience with the professional respect it deserves.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Interface**: React 18 + Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Custom Aura Glassmorphism System
- **Animation**: Framer Motion (Physics Transitions)
- **Architecture**: Service-Oriented "Edge" Persistence (LocalStorage Kernel)
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Shadcn + Lucide Icons
